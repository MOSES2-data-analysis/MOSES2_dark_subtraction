; Deconvolve using Fourier Translation theorem
; If the measured data is represented as
; f(t) = g(t) + b*g(t + a)
; where g(t) is the single image (the target), 
; f(t) is the measured image
; b is a scalar representing the relative intensity of the peaks
; a is a vector representing the spatial distance between the peaks
